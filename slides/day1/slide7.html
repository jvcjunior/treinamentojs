        <strong>Function Declaration</strong>
        A Function Declaration defines a named function variable without requiring variable assignment. 
        Function Declarations occur as standalone constructs and cannot be nested within non-function blocks. 
        It’s helpful to think of them as siblings of Variable Declarations. Just as Variable Declarations must 
        start with “var”, Function Declarations must begin with “function”.
        <strong>Function Expression</strong>
        A Function Expression defines a function as a part of a larger expression syntax (typically a
        variable assignment ). Functions defined via Functions Expressions can be named or anonymous. 
        Function Expressions must not start with “function” (hence the parentheses around the self invoking
        example below)
