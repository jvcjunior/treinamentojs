        <strong>JIT compilers</strong>
        The principle problem with the classic architecture is that runtime bytecode interpretation is slow. 
        The performance can be improved with the addition of a compilation step to convert the bytecode into
        machine code. Unfortunately waiting several minutes for a web page to fully compile isn’t going to
        make your browser very popular.

        The solution to this is “lazy compilation” by a JIT, or Just In Time compiler. As the name would suggest, 
        it compiles parts of your code into machine code, just in time for you to need it. JIT compilers come in
        a variety of categories, each with their own strategies for optimisation. Some like say a Regular Expression
        compiler are dedicated to optimising a single task; whereas others may optimise common operations such as
        loops or functions. A modern JavaScript engine will employ several of these compilers, all working together
        improve the performance of your code.
