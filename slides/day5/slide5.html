     The __proto__ property of Object.prototype is an accessor property (a getter function and a setter function) 
     that exposes the internal [[Prototype]] (either an object or null) of the object through which it is accessed.

    The use of __proto__ is controversial, and has been discouraged. It was never originally included in the 
    EcmaScript language spec, but modern browsers decided to implement it anyway. Only recently, the __proto__ property 
    has been standardized in the ECMAScript 6 language specification for web browsers to ensure compatibility, so will be 
    supported into the future.
